Variables are simply storage locations. Every variable is known by its name and stores some known and unknown piece of information known as value. 
So one can define a variable by its data type and name, a data type is responsible for allocating memory for the variable. In Scala there are two types of variables: 

Mutable Variables
Immutable Variables
Letâ€™s understand each one of these variables in detail. 

Mutable Variable: These variables are those variables that allow us to change a value after the declaration of a variable.
Mutable variables are defined by using the var keyword. The first letter of data type should be in capital letter because in Scala data type is treated as objects.



Immutable Variable: 
These variables are those variables that do not allow you to change a value after the declaration of a variable. Immutable variables are defined by using the val keyword. The first letter of data type should be in capital letter because in Scala data type is treated as objects. 







Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called as literal/constant. 
The literals are a series of symbols utilized for describing a constant value in the code. 
There are many types of literals in Scala namely Character literals, String literals, Multi-Line String literals, Boolean literals, Integer literals, and Floating point literals.
