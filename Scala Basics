Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It is a pure object-oriented programming language which also provides the support to the functional programming approach. There is no concept of primitive data as everything is an object in Scala. It is designed to express the general programming patterns in a refined, succinct, and type-safe way. Scala programs can convert to bytecodes and can run on the JVM(Java Virtual Machine). Scala stands for Scalable language. It also provides the JavaScript runtimes. Scala is highly influenced by Java and some other programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, Pizza, etc.
